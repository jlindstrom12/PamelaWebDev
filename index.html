            <p>  &emsp;&emsp;Our small diner has become a staple in Pittsburgh. crêpe-style pancakes, omelets and Lyonnaise potatoes. Some of our nicknames we have gained over the years include the "pantheon of pancake purveyors" and a “Treasure of Pittsburgh”. In 2013 we were featured on the wall street journal in a “What to Do in Pittsburgh” feature.</p><br/> 

                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Our diner is owned by Gail Kilngensmith and Pam Cohen. Both of them were educated as teachers and both business partners shandel different tasks with Kilngensmith generally handels the business end while Cohen is known as “The culinary artist” meaning she is the one who is designing our menu. </p><br/>
                
               <p>&emsp;&emsp;Our first location was opened in the Squirrel Hill Neighborhood opening 1979 which has since closed due to Covid-19 and the loss of several long-time employees. Since then we have had locations opening in Shadyside, The Stript District, Oakland, and Mt. Lebanon. Hopefully with more to come in the future.</p><br/>
                
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;One of our proudest accomplishments is during the 2008 presidential election Barak Obama visited our diner for a campaign visit. Once elected Obama invited our founders to the white house for a memorial day breakfast with the Obama family and 80 veterans.
